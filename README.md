# diffusing-across-the-spiderverse
CS 236 (Deep Generative Models) final project - Anuj Shetty, Huram-Abi Nzia Yotchoum, Daniel Sorvisto (M.S. ICME

This repo was only created for submission and likely requires some tweaks to run as is, as each of the subfolders are different repos that we modified in parallel. 

Added inference_cs236.ipynb and lora_train.sh in diffusers/examples/text_to_image/ for the LoRA experiments.
Added lora_dreambooth_inference_cs236.ipynb in peft/examples/lora_dreambooth/ for the DreamBooth experiments.
Added calc_kid.ipynb in textual-inversion/ and modified some of the configs and scripts for different runs of textual inversion.

textual-inversion/ has some of the data and outputs, but most of the data has not been included in this repo.
